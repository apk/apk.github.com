# Not the sun

<div align='center'><img src='/images/darksun.jpg' style='border: 1px solid darkgreen;'></div>

This image is not quite what it seems, but it is difficult to ask what is wrong with
it without giving the solution away. The object in the upper right causing the severe
backlit situation is not the sun, but the moon, and the faint dots in the free sky
are stars. I just had to light up the image somewhat because it was taken free-hand,
and proper exposure wasn't doable without a tripod.

# tor relay traffic again

<a href="">Previously</a> I wrote how my slower relay was
much slower than the ratio of advertised bandwitdth warranted,
and also that this was normal in the tor network.

Well, not quite. That relay then started picking up traffic
four months after it was moved from the previous host, and
the rise itself took three weeks. Since the it is at about
one MByte/s which match the other relay's rate.

No specific explanation as to why. (The entire graph goes from
mid of may '16 to end of january '17; gnuplot botches the legend
a bit.)
